/**
 * STEP 2 — THE READER AND THE LAUNCH
 * ============================================================
 *
 * This is the accuracy. Step 1 works out WHERE the beats are; this fires
 * them WHEN YOU HEAR THEM, at the right height, in the right place.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST "TIMING"
 *   A launch has three things and all three must be right:
 *
 *     WHEN      fire on the audio output's playback head
 *     WHERE     where along the line it rises
 *     HOW HIGH  the strength it carries
 *
 *   ONE WRONG HEIGHT DESTROYS THE WHOLE SCENE. You do not read the waves
 *   one at a time - you read the surface as one shape. So a single outlier
 *   does not look like "one wave is a bit big", it looks like the whole
 *   thing is broken, because the pattern the eye was reading just got
 *   contradicted.
 *
 *   THE BAR IS NOT "most waves land right". THE BAR IS: NO OUTLIERS.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS DOES
 *   - holds the beat timeline from Step 1
 *   - each frame, is told where the audio output is
 *   - launches every beat the output has now reached
 *   - clamps the height and the position so no wave can be an outlier
 *   - hands back the waves that are alive, each with its own age
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 *   It does not draw. The glow view draws. This decides what to draw.
 *
 * NO ALLOCATION PER FRAME
 *   The live waves are a fixed pool, reused. Nothing here allocates in the
 *   frame loop, because memory must not increase.
